To create a bot:

1. In Telegram, start a chat with @BotFather (open the chat window and press “START”).

2. Send the command “/newbot”.

3. BotFather will ask you to choose a name for your bot. This is the name users will see in their contacts.

4. BotFather will then ask you to choose a bot username, which must end with “bot”. If the desired username is not
available, you can try again with “yourname_bot” or “yournamebot”, or anything else.

5. Once the username is set, BotFather will send you a long message with the API token, which will look similar to this:
 73823745:dAExgIN1ss2k0dZsiFkV3vLgst0dC0FHfF2.

6. Start a chat with @BBFBot and press "Create a bot".

7. Forward that long message from BotFather to BBF.

8. All set. Your bot is ready to use.

Please enjoy your bot and the service provided by BBF. Rate us here: https://telegram.me/storebot?start=bbfbot

BROADCAST_ADMIN_TUTORIAL = """
This is what you can do with your bot:

1. Start a chat with your bot. If this is your very first chat with it, you will see the bot description that you can
set up through @BotFather; press "START". If this is not the first chat, click on the menu button.

2. You can now see the full menu with user and admin commands.

3. “About” will show you the information message of the bot, which is blank initially. You can set up what is shown
there by going into "About" -> "Set About" (this can be a text or a media message).

4. "New Post" lets you create a post to be sent to your subscribers. Note that you can include up to 10 messages
in one post containing text, images, audio, video and documents. You may preview the post first, or publish it
(i.e. send it out) straight away.

5. "Custom Menu" lets you create your own commands / menu buttons. Press "Add sub command", choose the name of the new
command and then create the bot's response to it. It can be a message or a set of messages containing text, images,
audio, video, and documents. You may hide or show ("Publish") custom commands at any time.

6. “Stats” will show you how many subscribers your bot has and the number of the bot's unique chats and messages
in the last 24 hours.

7. “Admins” lets you add or remove admins of the bot.

Please enjoy your bot and the service provided by BBF. Rate us here: https://telegram.me/storebot?start=bbfbot
